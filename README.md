# Tomagotchi
A Tomagotchi character. Inspired by Gen 1.
I do not own Tomagotchi nor do I sell this code. This is purely for coding practice.

TODO:
- Have a reset button that calls localStorage.clear() and then the characterController.initialize() method again. Before clearing everything, it prompts you with an alert asking if you 
are sure you want to reset your Tamagotchi.
